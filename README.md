and scripts:

   1. tariff_models.py ‚Äî First to run, Shared Model Functions

Contains helper functions for training and saving machine learning models.

Functions are imported into the training scripts (train_classifier.py, train_kmean.py, train_regression.py) to avoid code duplication.

   2. train_regression.py ‚Äî Price Forecasting Model Trainer

Trains a Linear Regression model to predict future commodity prices.

Loads historical commodity price data from CMO-Historical-Data-Monthly.xlsx.

Fits the model using previous months' prices as input features.

Saves the trained model to:
‚ûî models/price_forecast_model.pkl

Run this file after tariff_models.py to create the forecasting model.

   3. train_kmean.py ‚Äî Clustering Model Trainer
   
Trains a KMeans clustering model to group commodities based on their price trends.

Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for cluster visualization.

Automatically determines the optimal number of clusters using Silhouette Score.

Saves:

Clustering model ‚ûî models/clustering_model.pkl

Cluster visualization ‚ûî commodity_clusters.png

Run this file third to create the clustering model.

   4. train_classifier.py ‚Äî Risk Classification Model Trainer
   
Trains a Decision Tree Classifier to predict commodity risk levels (High / Medium / Low).

Defines risk categories based on recent price volatility.

Saves the trained classifier model to:
‚ûî models/risk_classification_model.pkl

Run this file fourth to create the risk prediction model.

   5. tariff_dashboard.py ‚Äî Streamlit Web Application
Combines all three models into an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

Allows users to:

Forecast future commodity prices.

View cluster analysis of commodities.

Predict commodity risk levels.

Loads models from the models/ folder.

Displays interactive charts, tables, and predictions.
